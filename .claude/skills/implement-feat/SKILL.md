description: Work every subtask of a parent GitHub issue in dependency order, each one delegated to a subagent running work-issue, merging into a shared feature branch and pausing for validation between subtasks. Use when the user references a parent/feature issue and says "work on feature N", "implement feature N", or "/implement-feat".

# Implement Feature

Take a parent GitHub issue with sub-issues (created e.g. by `story-to-tickets`) from **dependency-ordered subtasks → merged feature branch → PR into the repo's default integration branch**, delegating each subtask to `work-issue`.

This skill never writes code itself — it orchestrates. All code changes happen inside subagents running `work-issue` in its "Orchestrated mode".

## Hard rules

1. **Stateless.** Never keep a local progress file. Every run re-derives where things stand from GitHub (sub-issue state/labels, open PRs against the feature branch) so the flow survives being resumed in a new session.
2. **Sequential, always.** Even subtasks with no dependency between them are worked one at a time, in topological order. Never run two subtask subagents concurrently — it risks both worktrees diverging from the same feature branch base.
3. **Never invent a branch/dependency order** you're not confident in. Cycles, missing sub-issue references, or no usable slug for the branch name are all reasons to stop and ask, not to guess.
4. **This skill owns the parent issue exclusively** (labels, closing). `work-issue` subagents must never touch it — see the "Orchestrated mode" section of `work-issue/SKILL.md`.

## Flow

### 1. Gather subtasks and resolve order

```bash
gh issue view <parent> --json title,labels,state
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent>/sub_issues -q '.[].number'
```

For each sub-issue, fetch its body (`gh issue view <n> --json body`) and look for `Depends on #N` / `Blocked by #N` references to other sub-issues in the same set. Build a topological order from these edges.

- If the graph has a cycle, or a dependency references a number that isn't one of the parent's sub-issues, **stop** and ask the user how to resolve it before doing anything else (no label, no branch).
- No separate confirmation gate otherwise — once the order is resolved cleanly, proceed directly to step 2.

### 2. Label the parent and create the feature branch

```bash
gh issue edit <parent> --add-label "in progress"
```

Pick a slug for the branch name from one of the parent's existing labels — skip generic/status labels (`in progress`, `p0`/`p1`/`p2`, etc.) and use whichever label identifies the story/feature (the one `story-to-tickets` creates). **If no usable label exists, stop and ask the user for the slug** — do not guess one from the title.

```bash
git fetch origin
# Prefer the repo's integration branch (usually origin/main, or origin/dev if the project uses one — see AGENTS.md's Releases section)
git branch feat/<slug> origin/<integration-branch>
git push -u origin feat/<slug>
```

This skill runs from the main checkout — no worktree of its own, since it never edits code, only runs `git`/`gh` plumbing.

### 3. Work each subtask in order

Subagents cannot call `AskUserQuestion` — only you (this orchestrator) can. So the plan gate and the post-PR validation gate both move to you, outside the `work-issue` subagent's turn.

For each sub-issue N in the resolved order:

1. **Plan.** Launch `Agent` with `subagent_type: general-purpose` in a read-only **planning** role: fetch issue N (`gh issue view <n> --comments`), explore related code, and return a short implementation plan (files to touch, approach, tests to write) in its final report. It must not create a worktree, write code, or attempt to call `AskUserQuestion`.
2. **Approve.** Present that plan to the user yourself via `AskUserQuestion`. If they want changes, relaunch the planning subagent with their feedback (or revise the plan yourself) and ask again. Do not proceed until approved.
3. **Implement.** Launch a fresh `Agent` with `subagent_type: general-purpose` (it needs the `Skill` tool) to invoke the `work-issue` skill for issue N, explicitly stating this is **orchestrated mode**: base branch is `feat/<slug>` (already exists, do not create it), never touch the parent issue, open the PR against `feat/<slug>`, and stop short of merging/cleanup/closing the subtask issue. Include the **approved plan verbatim** in the prompt and instruct it to skip its own step 1 (planning) entirely — go straight to worktree creation with the given plan. Once the PR is open and CI is green (if applicable), it ends its turn and reports the PR URL + CI status; it must not stop-and-wait or call `AskUserQuestion` for post-PR validation (see `work-issue`'s "Orchestrated mode" section for the full contract — link it in the prompt).
4. **Validate.** Once the subagent's turn ends, ask the user yourself via `AskUserQuestion` whether to merge the subtask PR.
5. On approval, merge the subtask's PR into the feature branch:
   ```bash
   gh pr merge <subtask-pr> --merge
   ```
   (adjust to squash/rebase if that's this repo's convention). Delete the remote subtask branch if it isn't cleaned up automatically.
6. Now that the subagent's turn has ended, finish what it deferred: close the subtask issue if `Closes #N` didn't auto-close it, remove its "in progress" label, and remove its worktree — `EnterWorktree(path: .claude/worktrees/issue-<n>)` followed by `ExitWorktree(action: "remove", discard_changes: true)`.
7. Move to the next subtask in the order.

### 4. Close out the feature

Once every subtask is merged into `feat/<slug>`:

```bash
git push origin feat/<slug>
gh pr create --base <integration-branch> --head feat/<slug> \
  --title "<Feature title>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- <one bullet per merged subtask>

## Test plan
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes
- [ ] `npm test` passes
- [ ] Manual validation of the full feature end-to-end

Closes #<parent>
EOF
)"
```

Then **stop** and ask the user to validate the whole feature (not just the individual subtasks) before merging.

On approval:

```bash
gh pr merge <feature-pr> --merge
gh issue edit <parent> --remove-label "in progress"
gh issue view <parent> --json state -q .state   # if still OPEN:
gh issue close <parent> --comment "Done in #<feature-PR>."
```

## Resuming a partial run

Re-derive everything from GitHub — don't assume anything about a prior session:

- Sub-issues already `closed` (and merged into the feature branch) → skip.
- An open sub-issue with an open PR against `feat/<slug>` → pick up at the validation step for that one, don't relaunch its subagent.
- An open sub-issue with no PR yet → next one to launch, once its dependencies (per the graph) are satisfied.
- Feature branch already exists → skip step 2's branch creation, but still confirm the parent has the "in progress" label.
